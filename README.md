b. Write an example PL/SQL block that inserts a new arbitrary row to the COUNTRIES table.  The block should handle the exception DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX and OTHERS. Run the block for different COUNTRY_ID and observe the cases when above exception occurs.
```sql
DECLARE 
	
	
	
BEGIN 
	
	INSERT INTO COUNTRIES(COUNTRY_ID,COUNTRY_NAME,REGION_ID)
	VALUES('AR','Argentina_Best',2);
	
EXCEPTION 

	WHEN DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX THEN

		DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Sorry, Duplicate values cannot be stored in Unique declared columns');
				
	WHEN OTHERS THEN

		DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Unknown Error occurred');
	
END;

a. In Oracle, there is a function TO_NUMBER that converts a VARCHAR2 value to a numeric value. If the input to this function is not a valid number, then this function throws an exception. This is a problem in a SQL query because the whole query would not produce any result if one row generates an exception. So, your job is to write a PL/SQL function ISNUMBER that receives an input VARCHAR2 value and checks whether the input can be converted to a valid number. If the input can be converted to a valid number than ISNUMBER should return ‘YES’, otherwise ISNUMBER should return ‘NO’.<br>
```sql
